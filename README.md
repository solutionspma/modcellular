Mod Cellular

Mod Cellular is a modular wireless experimentation stack for exploring modern mobile infrastructure. It combines eSIMs, carrier APIs, VoIP routing, data-aware mobile testing, and early mesh/private network concepts into a single learning and prototyping environment.

This project exists to understand how cellular, VoIP, and edge networking actually work together—without legacy carrier lock-in or opaque tooling.

What this is
	•	A sandbox, not a carrier
	•	A place to test wireless numbers, eSIMs, data usage, and routing
	•	A bridge between VoIP, mobile, and private network thinking
	•	Infrastructure-first, UI-second

What this is not
	•	Not a consumer phone service
	•	Not a replacement for major carriers
	•	Not production telecom (yet)

Core areas of exploration
	•	eSIM provisioning and mobile behavior
	•	Wireless vs VoIP number models
	•	Data usage and cost control
	•	SIP, call routing, and forwarding
	•	Private LTE / CBRS / mesh-adjacent concepts
	•	Edge and property-based network ideas

Philosophy

Learn by building.
Test before scaling.
Understand the network, don’t just consume it.

Status

Active experimentation.
Expect iteration, dead ends, and documentation that evolves with understanding.
